ADT Priority Queue - implementation on a binary search tree

Problem statement - Rescuing the human race based on status
An extraterrestrial species has attacked planet Earth and it is about to be
destroyed. Unfortunately, only m humans can embark on the rescue spaceship, based
on their priority levels, as follows:
Politicians – priority level 4
Scientists – priority level 3
Doctors – priority level 2
Priests – priority level 1
Commoners – priority level 0
Simulate the process of rescuing the human race by adding a human to the spaceship,
removing a human from the spaceship and displaying all the humans that have been
saved.

My assigned ADT, the priority queue is suitable for solving the chosen problem
because each human has a priority level and they can only embark the spaceship if
they have the highest priority level.
In other words, we start with an empty priority queue (an empty spaceship) and
first we “push” the politicians, then the scientists, then the doctors, then the priests
and then the commoners, while we check not to have a full spaceship.
